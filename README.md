# Linear Regression Practice Lab – Week 2 

This repository contains my programming assignment for **Week 2 of Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning – Regression and Classification** from the **Machine Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

##  Description

In this practice lab, I implemented **univariate linear regression** from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to understand how **gradient descent** can be used to minimize the cost function and fit a line to a simple dataset.

### Core Concepts Covered:
- Cost function and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Gradient descent optimization
- Model prediction and parameter updates
- Visualization of cost vs iteration
- Plotting the regression line with `matplotlib`

##  Files Included

- `gradient_descent_lab.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation and visualizations
- `lab_utils_uni.py`: Helper functions for computing cost and gradients
- `data/`: Contains the input data used for training (univariate CSV)

> ⚠️ This repository includes only my original implementation and learning material in accordance with Coursera’s Honor Code.

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
